## PSA Crypto

### Description

TODO: Jaeden


### Specification
TODO: Jaeden - describe here about APIs being available from NSPE and SPE
about differences in behaviour if any

PSA specification can be found here [PSA Secure Storage](https://pages.arm.com/PSA-APIs)

### Doxygen

TODO: Jaeden - find PSA crypto APIs in doxygen web site. I was not able to find it. 
      Perhaps MBED_TLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C macro should be added doxyfile_options file so PSA crypto docs will be generated 
      Once addded Doxygen will be generate - perhaps on next day fix the link below
