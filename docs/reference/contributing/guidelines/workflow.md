## Workflow

All code changes and additions to Mbed OS are handled through GitHub. If you want to contribute, either by adding features or by fixing bugs, please follow the guidelines for [new features](#features) and [bugs](#reporting-bugs). In both cases, please follow the [code style guide and GitHub pull request guidelines](/docs/development/reference/guidelines.html#style). Please also read the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](/docs/development/reference/guidelines.html#cla) guidelines because we will immediately close pull requests submitted without a CLA.

### Mbed OS maintainers

The maintainers are a small group of Mbed OS engineers who are responsible for the Mbed OS codebase. Their primary role is to progress contributions, both internal and external, from the initial pull request state through to released code. 

Responsibilities:

1. Check for CLA compliance.
1. Ensure the relevant stakeholders review pull requests.
1. Guide contributors both technically and procedurally.
1. Run pull requests through the CI systems.
1. Put label version.
1. Merge pull requests into the requested branches.
1. Make periodic patch and feature releases.

The current maintainers are:

- [Anna Bridge](https://os.mbed.com/users/AnnaBridge).
- [Martin Kojtal](https://os.mbed.com/users/Kojto).
- [Jimmy Brisson](https://os.mbed.com/users/theotherjimmy).
- [Shrikant Tudavekar](https://os.mbed.com/users/shrikant1213).
- [Sam Grove](https://os.mbed.com/users/sam_grove).
- [Cruz Monrreal](https://os.mbed.com/users/MrCruz).
- [Kevin Bracey](https://os.mbed.com/users/kjbracey).

### Contributions

Before contributing an enhancement (new feature, new port and so on), please [discuss it on the forums](https://os.mbed.com/forum/bugs-suggestions/) to avoid duplication of work, as we or others might be working on a related feature.

We can only accept contributions through GitHub if you create a pull request from forked versions of our repositories. This allows us to review the contributions in an easy-to-use and reliable way, under public scrutiny.

Please create separate pull requests for each concern; each pull request needs a clear unity of purpose. In particular, separate code formatting and style changes from functional changes. This makes each pull request’s true contribution clearer, so review is quicker and easier.

#### Reporting bugs

Please submit all Mbed OS bugs [on the forums](https://os.mbed.com/forum/bugs-suggestions/).

The bug report should be reproducible (fails for others) and specific (where and how it fails). We will close insufficient bug reports. 

We copy issues reported on GitHub to our internal tracker (`ARM Internal Ref: MBOTRIAGE-XXX` comment in the issues and label mirrored set once copied) and regularly triage them.

### Guidelines for GitHub pull requests

Pull requests on GitHub have to meet the following requirements to keep the code and commit history clean:

- Commits should always contain a proper description of their content. Start with a concise and sensible one-line description. Then, elaborate on reasoning of the choices made, descriptions for reviewers and other information that might otherwise be lost.
- You should always write commits to allow publication, so they can never contain confidential information, reference private documents, links to intranet locations or rude language.
- Each commit should be the minimum self-contained commit for a change. A commit should always result in a new state that is again in a compilable state. You should (if possible) split large changes into logical smaller commits that help reviewers follow the reasoning behind the full change.
- Commits and pull request titles should follow [Chris Beam’s seven rules of great commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit#seven-rules):
	1. Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.
	1. Limit the subject line to 72 characters (note that this is a deviation from Beam's standard).
	1. Capitalize the subject line.
	1. Do not end the subject line with a period.
	1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
	1. Wrap the body at 72 characters.
	1. Use the body to explain _what_ and _why_ vs _how_.
- Because we use GitHub and explicit CLAs, special commit tags that other projects may use, such as “Reviewed-by”, or “Signed-off-by”, are redundant and should be omitted. GitHub tracks who reviewed what and when, and our stack of signed CLAs shows us who has agreed to our development contribution agreement.
- Prefixing your commit message with a domain is acceptable, and we recommend doing so when it makes sense. However, prefixing one's domain with the name of the repo is not useful. For example, making a commit entitled "mbed-drivers: Fix doppelwidget frobulation" to the `mbed-drivers` repo is not acceptable because it is already understood that the commit applies to `mbed-drivers`. Renaming the commit to "doppelwidget: Fix frobulation" would be better, if we presume that "doppelwidget" is a meaningful domain for changes, because it communicates that the change applies to the doppelwidget area of `mbed-drivers`.
- All new features and enhancements require documentation, tests and user guides for us to accept them. Please link each pull request to all relevant documentation and test pull requests.
- Avoid merging commmits. (Always rebase when possible.)
- Comment in the pull request on every change (rebase or new commits). This helps reviewers to be up to date with changes
- Pull requests should fix a bug, add a feature or refactor.

#### Release versioning

You can find Mbed OS versioning at [How We Release Arm Mbed OS](/docs/development/introduction/how-we-release-arm-mbed-os.html).

### Pull request categories

#### Bug fixes

Every bug fix should contain a test to verify results prior to and after the pull request.

#### Changes and additions

Backward compatible changes (such as refactoring and enhancements) or new target additions can go into patch and feature releases. We only consider features and new functionality additions for feature releases.

#### Features

We initially implement new features on separate branches in the Mbed OS repository. Mbed OS maintainers create the new branches by following the naming convention: "feature-" prefix.

Each feature has a tech lead. This person is responsible for:

- Rebasing often to track master development.
- Reviewing any addition to the feature branch (approval required by the feature tech lead or another assigned person).

### Pull request types

We consider the following pull request types.

#### Fix

A bug fix is a backward-compatible internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.

Release: patch

#### Refactor

Refactors are intended for feature releases, if they are not fixing specific issues, because they can introduce new issues.

Release: feature

#### New target

Adding a new target is a change for a patch release because it updates the targets folder implementation.

Release: patch

#### Feature

New features target feature releases. A new feature can only be integrated if the feature supports most of the targets (if it requires new target HAL implementation).

We consider adding a new functionality to be a feature. It does not matter if it is C++, C or Python.

Release: feature

#### Breaking change

A breaking change is any change that results in breaking user space. It should have strong justification for us to consider it. Often, such changes can be backward compatible, for example, deprecating the old functionality and introducing the new replacement.

Release: major

### Pull request template

Below is a good example of a pull request:

```
Fix deep sleep locking bug

# Description

Fix problems that could leave deep sleep locked unintentionally, along with adding tests to verify this behavior is fixed.

Tested locally with two targets and all toolchains.

You can see test results [here](just an example). 

# Pull request type

[x] Fix
[ ] Refactor
[ ] New Target
[ ] Feature

```

### GitHub pull requests workflow

Each pull request goes through the following workflow:

<span class="images">![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mbed-os-docs-images/Workflow.png)<span>The workflow of merging a pull request</span></span>

### Pull request states

The Mbed OS maintainers add labels to a pull request that represent the pull request workflow states. The Mbed OS maintainers are responsible for moving pull requests through the workflow states.

Each state is time boxed. In most cases, this is sufficient time to move to another state. The pull request can be closed if no update is provided within the time frame.

#### Reviews

All pull requests must be reviewed. The Arm Mbed CI bot determines the most suitable person to review the pull request and tags that person accordingly.

Github dismisses a reviewer's status after any change to the pull request commit history (such as adding a new commit or rebasing). Smaller changes, such as documentation edits or rebases on top of latest master, only require additonal review by maintainers. Their approval is sufficient because a team assigned as a reviewer already approved the pull request.

Time: 3 days for reviewers to leave feedback after the maintainers add the "needs: review" label.

#### The CI (Continuous Integration) testing

There are many CI systems available. Which CI tests we run against a particular pull request depends on the effect that pull request has on the code base. Irrespective of which CI tests run, Mbed OS has an all green policy, meaning that all the CI jobs that are triggered must pass before we merge the pull request.

Time: 1 day for CI to complete and report back results.

#### Work needed

A pull request in the work needed state requires additional work due to failed tests, or rework as a result of the review. If a pull request is in this state, then our maintainers request changes from the pull request author.

Time: 3 days for the pull request author to action the review comments.

#### Releases

When we merge a pull request that we will publish in a patch release, we tag the pull request with the specific patch release version. This is the release in which we first publish this pull request. For patch releases, we allow only bug fixes, new targets and enhancements to existing functionality. New features only go in feature releases.

The release tag has the following format:

*release-version: 5.f.p* - Where `f` is the feature release and `p` the patch release.

### Additional labels

We use many other labels to summarize the scope and effect of the changes.

- *needs: preceding PR* - This pull request cannot yet be merged because it has a dependency on another pull request that needs to merge first.
- *DO NOT MERGE* - This pull request contains changes that may be in a draft state and submitted purely for review, or may contain breaking changes that have not been considered.
- *devices: 'name'* - The pull request specifically affects the named device(s).
- *component: 'name'* - The pull request specifically affects the named component.

The following labels summarize the scope of the pull request.

- *scope: bug-fix*.
- *scope: feature*.
- *scope: new-target*.
