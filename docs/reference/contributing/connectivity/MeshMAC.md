<h2 id="mac-port">MAC API porting</h2>

Nanostack has a lower level API for the IEEE 802.15.4-2006 MAC standard. This enables developers to support different MACs, be it SW or HW based solutions. Nanostack offers SW MAC, which you can use when your board does not have 15.4 MAC available.
SW MAC have also subset support for listed IEEE 802.15.4-2015 MAC standard data frame services and Enhanced ACK.

### SW MAC

Nanostack includes an IEEE 802.15.4 based SW MAC class. You can use SW MAC when your board does not support MAC. To use the SW MAC service you must have a working RF driver registered to Nanostack. To create SW MAC, call the following function:

```
ns_sw_mac_create()
```

This creates an SW MAC class and sets a callback function to be used by Nanostack.

<span class="notes">**Note:** You must not call `ns_sw_mac_create()` more than once!</span>

#### SW MAC IEEE 802.15.4-2015 subset extension

SW MAC support subset from IEEE 802.15.4-2015 standard. Subset include next supported features.

- Data frame send with Payload and Header Information element's defined by MAC user.
- Enhanced ACK generation and send by MAC
- Enhanced ACK payload and Information elemen's write for MAC user

Subset features need proper supported RF driver with new extented driver API commands.

### Initializing SW MAC

Deploy SW MAC as follows:

1. Call `arm_net_phy_register()` to register the configured RF driver class to Nanostack.
2. Call `ns_sw_mac_create()` to create SW MAC with needed list sizes.
    - a sleepy device needs only 1-4 as the size of the `device_decription_table_size`.
    - the minimum and recommended `key_description_table_size` for the Thread stack is 4. (2 for 6LoWPAN)
    - the recommended value for `key_lookup_size` is 1 and for `key_usage_size` 3.
3. Call `arm_nwk_interface_lowpan_init()` to create Nanostack with the created SW MAC class. Nanostack will initialize SW MAC before using it.

### Example

See a simple code snippet for creating SW MAC with 16 as neighbor table size with three key descriptions:

```
int8_t generate_6lowpan_interface(int8_t rf_phy_device_register_id)
{
    mac_description_storage_size_t storage_sizes;
    storage_sizes.device_decription_table_size = 16;
    storage_sizes.key_description_table_size = 3;
    storage_sizes.key_lookup_size = 1;
    storage_sizes.key_usage_size = 3;
    mac_api_t *mac_api = ns_sw_mac_create(rf_phy_device_register_id, &storage_sizes);
    if (!mac_api) {
        tr_error("Mac create fail!");
        return -1;
    }
    return arm_nwk_interface_lowpan_init(mac_api, "6LoWPAN_ROUTER");
}
```

### Enabling FHSS

SW MAC supports FHSS. To enable it, you need to do the following:

1. Call `arm_net_phy_register()` to register the configured RF driver class to Nanostack.
2. Call `ns_sw_mac_create()` to create SW MAC with needed list sizes.
3. Call `ns_fhss_create()` to configure and define the FHSS class.
4. Call `ns_sw_mac_fhss_register()` to register FHSS to SW MAC.
5. Call `arm_nwk_interface_lowpan_init()` to create Nanostack with the created SW MAC class.

### IEEE 802.15.4 MAC sublayer APIs

The stack uses the IEEE 802.15.4 defined MAC management service entity (MLME-SAP) and MAC data service (MCPS-SAP) interfaces. MAC API follows MCPS and MLME primitives defined by the IEEE 802.15.4-2006 standard.

The following primitives are used in MAC layer:

| Primitive | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Request | Request made by service user. |
| Confirm | MAC layer response to earlier request. |
| Indication | Indication event from MAC to service user. |
| Response | Service user's response to received indication. |

MAC API is defined in the following header files:

- `mac_api.h` Main header which defines a transparent MAC API for Nanostack to use.
- `mlme.h` Definitions for MLME-SAP primitives.
- `mac_mcps.h` Definitions for MCPS-SAP primitives.
- `mac_common_defines.h` Definitions for common MAC constants.

### MCPS-SAP interface

MCPS-SAP defines 802.15.4 data flow API with the following primitives:

| Primitive | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `MCPS-DATA-REQ` | Data request primitive to MAC. |
| `MCPS-DATA-CONF` | MAC generated confirmation for ongoing `MCPS-DATA-REQ`. |
| `MCPS-DATA-IND` | MAC generated data indication event. |
| `MCPS-PURGE-REQ` | Cancel ongoing `MCPS-DATA-REQ` from MAC. |
| `MCPS-PURGE-CONF` | Confirmation from MAC to `MCPS-PURGE-REQ` operation. |

### MLME-SAP interface

MLME-SAP defines a set of different management primitives and this chapter introduces both supported and unsupported primitives in Nanostack.

#### Supported MLME APIs

### MAC API class introduction

This chapter introduces MAC mesh interface `mac_api_s`. It is a structure that defines the function callbacks needed by a service user.

The base class defines the functions for two-way communications between an external MAC and service user. The application creates a `mac_api_s` object by calling the MAC adapter's create function. The newly created object is then passed to Nanostack which initializes its own callback functions by calling the `mac_api_initialize()` function. A service user operates MAC by calling MLME or MCPS primitive functions.

The MAC API class structure `mac_api_t` is defined as below:

```
typedef struct mac_api_s {
    //Service user defined initialization function which is called when Nanostack takes MAC into use
    mac_api_initialize              *mac_initialize;
    mac_api_enable_mcps_ext     *mac_mcps_extension_enable;
    //MAC adapter function callbacks for MLME & MCPS SAP
    mlme_request                    *mlme_req;
    mcps_data_request               *mcps_data_req;
    mcps_data_request_ext       *mcps_data_req_ext;
    mcps_purge_request                  *mcps_purge_req;
    //Service user defined function callbacks
    mcps_data_confirm               *data_conf_cb;
    mcps_data_confirm_ext       *data_conf_ext_cb;
    mcps_data_indication                *data_ind_cb;
    mcps_data_indication_ext    *data_ind_ext_cb;
    mcps_ack_data_req_ext       *enhanced_ack_data_req_cb;
    mcps_purge_confirm                  *purge_conf_cb;
    mlme_confirm                        *mlme_conf_cb;
    mlme_indication                     *mlme_ind_cb;
    //MAC extension API for service user
    mac_ext_mac64_address_set           *mac64_set;
    mac_ext_mac64_address_get           *mac64_get;
    mac_storage_decription_sizes_get *mac_storage_sizes_get;
    int8_t                              parent_id;
    uint16_t                            phyMTU;

### MAC API standard extensions

This chapter introduces MAC API standard extensions.

#### MAC 64-bit address set and get

NanoStack uses 64-bit address set and get. There are two 64-bit addresses available:

- NVM EUI64.
- dynamic 64-bit address used at the link layer.

Thread generates a random MAC64 after commissioning. Therefore, MAC and the RF driver must support updating of radio's dynamic 64-bit address anytime.

Address set and get support two different 64-bit addresses:

| Address enumeration type | Description |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| `MAC_EXTENDED_READ_ONLY` | A unique EUI64. |
| `MAC_EXTENDED_DYNAMIC` | Dynamic 64-bit address. Same as EUI64 after boot. |

#### MAC max storage information get

Usually, HW MAC and SW MAC have static keys and neighbor list sizes. Nanostack always asks the max size to limit its neighbor table size. The service user must define the `mac_storage_sizes_get()` function returning the following values:

- MAC Device description list size (must be > 1).
- MAC Key description list size (must be > 1).

<span class="notes">**Note:** The Key description list size must be at least 4 if using Thread!</span>

#### MLME attribute extension

Nanostack uses MLME attribute extensions which have to be ported to the HW MAC adapter. To configure the extensions, use the `MLME-SET-REQ` command.

| Enumeration type | Value | Description |
| ---------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| `macAcceptByPassUnknowDevice` | `0xfc` | Accept data trough MAC if packet is data can be authenticated by group key and MIC. Security enforsment point must be handled carefully these packets. |
| `macLoadBalancingBeaconTx` | `0xfd` | Trigger to MAC layer to send a beacon. Called by the load balancer module periodically. |
| `macLoadBalancingAcceptAnyBeacon` | `0xfe` | Configure MAC layer to accept beacons from other networks. Enabled by load balancer, default value is `False`. Value size boolean, `true=enable`, `false=disable`. |
| `macThreadForceLongAddressForBeacon` | `0xff` | The Thread standard forces the beacon source address to have an extended 64-bit address. |

#### Thread Sleepy End Device (SED) keepalive extension

Thread 1.1 stack defines that the sleepy end device data poll process must enable the neighbor table keepalive functionality as well. When SED finishes data polling succesfully, it updates its parents keepalive value in a neighbor table. A service user at a parent device does not have a standard mechanism to indicate the data polling event. Therefore, the MAC layer must generate an `MLME-COMM-STATUS` indication callback with status `MLME_DATA_POLL_NOTIFICATION`.

Enumeration extension for MLME communication status enumeration:

| Enumeration type | Value | Description |
| ---------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| `MLME_DATA_POLL_NOTIFICATION` | `0xff` | Thread requirement for MLME-COMM-STATUS to start indicating the successful data poll events. |

### HW MAC

To use HW MAC, you need to create an adapter class that links function calls between Nanostack and HW MAC. To create the adapter class, you need to implement the functions defined in the `mac_api_s` structure. When HW MAC generates an event, the adapter must handle it and do a parameter adaptation before calling the correct function from the `mac_api_s` structure. You may need the same parameter adaptation for requests from Nanostack to HW MAC.

<span class="notes">**Note:** Function calls from Nanostack to HW MAC must be non-blocking in the adapter layer!</span>
