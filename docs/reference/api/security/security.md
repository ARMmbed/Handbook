## Security overview

Security on Arm Mbed OS is divided into two parts:

* [Connection security through Arm Mbed TLS](/docs/v5.6/reference/api-references.html#tls).
* [Device security through Arm Mbed uVisor](/docs/v5.6/reference/api-references.html#uvisor).

The sections cover working with these modules in the context of Mbed OS. For generic documentation for both modules, see:

* [Mbed TLS full documentation](https://tls.mbed.org/).
* [Mbed uVisor full documentation](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/uvisor-and-uvisor-lib-documentation/en/latest/).
