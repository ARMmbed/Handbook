## Memory tracing

Mbed OS provides a set of functions that you can use to study the runtime memory allocation pattern of your software: which sections of the code allocate and free memory and how much memory they need.

You must define the `MBED_MEM_TRACING_ENABLED` macro to enable memory tracing.

You can use the `mbed_mem_trace_set_callback` API to set the callback for memory tracing. The callback is invoked every time you call standard allocation functions, such as `malloc`, `realloc`, `calloc` and `free`.

For a step-by-step guide about how to use optimize memory using runtime memory tracing, please see our [runtime memory tracing tutorial](/docs/development/tutorials/optimizing.html#runtime-memory-tracing).
