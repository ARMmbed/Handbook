## TCPSocket

The TCPSocket class provides the ability to send a stream of data over TCP. TCPSockets maintain a stateful connection that starts with the `connect` member function. After successfully connecting to a server, you can use the `send` and `recv` member functions to send and receive data (similar to writing or reading from a file).
