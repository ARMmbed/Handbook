The CellularBase provides a C++ API for connecting to the internet over a Cellular device.

Arm Mbed OS provides a [reference implementation of CellularBase](https://os.mbed.com/docs/v5.8/mbed-os-api-doxy/_easy_cellular_connection_8h_source.html), which has more information.

### Usage

To bring up the network interface:

1. Instantiate an implementation of the CellularBase class.
1. Call the `connect(pincode, apn)` function with a PIN code for your SIM card and an APN for your network.
1. Once connected, you can use Mbed OS [network sockets](https://os.mbed.com/docs/v5.8/reference/network-socket.html) as usual.

### Cellular example: connection establishment
