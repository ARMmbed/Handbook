For changing any of these parameters, edit the `mbed_app.json` file in the root of your application. Prefix the parameter name with `lora.`, e.g., `lora.my-parameter: value`.

```json
"target_overrides": {
    "*": {
        "lora.device-address":  "0x12345678",
        "lora.over-the-air-activation": true,
        "lora.duty-cycle-on": true
    }
}
