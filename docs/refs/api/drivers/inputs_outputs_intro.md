### Peripherals

Peripheral APIs are the traditional API's used in microcontroller development (GPIO, PWM, I2C, SPI, UART ... etc). The Peripheral API's enable you to interract with and control the physical world. These API's form the basis for the majority of drivers like the Servo Driver, the LCD Drivers, and many more.
