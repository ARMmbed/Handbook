#### Ticker

Use the Ticker interface to set up a recurring interrupt; it calls a function repeatedly and at a specified rate.

You can create any number of Ticker objects, allowing multiple outstanding interrupts at the same time. The function can be a static function, or a member function of a particular object.

##### Warnings and notes

* Timers are based on 32-bit int microsecond counters, so they can only time up to a maximum of 2^31-1 microseconds (30 minutes). They are designed for times between microseconds and seconds. For longer times, you should consider the time() real time clock.

* No blocking code in ISR: avoid any call to wait, infinite while loop or blocking calls in general.

* No printf, malloc or new in ISR: avoid any call to bulky library functions. In particular, certain library functions (such as printf, malloc and new) are not re-entrant, and their behavior could be corrupted when called from an ISR.
