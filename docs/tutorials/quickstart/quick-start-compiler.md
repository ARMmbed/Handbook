<h2 id="quick-start-online">Using the Online Compiler</h2>

### Setting up

1. [Create an Mbed account](https://os.mbed.com/account/signup/).
1. Plug your Mbed board into your computer, and open its USB device folder.

    If you don't have a board but still want to follow the quick start, go to [os.mbed.com/platforms](http://os.mbed.com/platforms), select a board and click **Add to your Mbed Compiler**.

1. Double click on the `MBED.HTML` file. This adds your Mbed board to the Online Compiler as a compilation target.

    <span class="notes">**Note:** The Blinky example is configured to build with the bare metal profile by default. To enable the RTOS and other Mbed OS libraries, remove the following line from `mbed_app.json`:</span>
    ```NOCI
           "requires": ["bare-metal"],
    ```
1. Open the folder where the executable file was downloaded, and then click and drag (or copy and paste) the file to your Mbed board's USB device folder.

1. Press the board's reset button.
