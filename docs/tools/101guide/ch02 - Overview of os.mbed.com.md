## Overview of os.mbed.com

Right now we are only talking about Mbed OS ( [os.mbed.com](http://os.mbed.com)), which makes up the embedded side of the Mbed ecosystem. We discuss the other half, Arm Mbed Cloud ( [cloud.mbed.com](http://cloud.mbed.com)), later on. The two products have separate websites on the mbed.com domain, and you can switch websites at the top of the webpage.
