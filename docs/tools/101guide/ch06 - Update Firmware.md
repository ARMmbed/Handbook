## Update board firmware

If you have a problem with an out-of-the-box board, old firmware is a common culprit. To update the firmware for your board, go to the [Daplink Update Page](http://ArmMbed.github.io/DAPLink), look up your board and follow the instructions. 

If you are still having problems go to the [board page](http://os.mbed.com/platforms/) for your board and see if there are any other known board specific issues and workarounds.
