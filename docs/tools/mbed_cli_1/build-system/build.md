# Python-based build tools

This document describes python build tools located in Mbed Os under tools directory. They are used by Mbed CLI 1.

## User-defined build profile

As mentioned above, the __build profile__ defines the set of flags that is passed to the underlying compiler suite. You can also create a custom or user-defined __build profile__ using a JSON file according to the __build profile__ format mentioned in [JSON build profile format](#JSON-build-profile-format).

These flags stored in the JSON file are merged with other JSON files of the same structure when multiple `--profile` arguments are passed on the command line.

### JSON build profile format

The __build profiles__ are JSON files with the root object containing key-value pairs for each supported toolchain, such as `GCC_ARM`. Each key is a toolchain name and every value contains a mapping from a flag type to a list of flags that should be passed to the corresponding part of the compiler suite.

The required flag types are:

| Key      | Description                           |
|:---------|:--------------------------------------|
| `asm`    | Flags for the Assembler               |
| `c`      | Flags for the C Compiler              |
| `common` | Flags for both the C and C++ Compilers|
| `cxx`    | Flags for the C++ Compiler            |
| `ld`     | Flags for the Linker                  |

### Example

An example of a __build profile__:

```json
{
    "GCC_ARM": {
        "common": ["-c", "-Wall", "-Wextra",
                   "-Wno-unused-parameter", "-Wno-missing-field-initializers",
                   "-fmessage-length=0", "-fno-exceptions", "-fno-builtin",
                   "-ffunction-sections", "-fdata-sections", "-funsigned-char",
                   "-MMD", "-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks",
                   "-fomit-frame-pointer", "-Os"],
        "asm": ["-x", "assembler-with-cpp"],
        "c": ["-std=gnu99"],
        "cxx": ["-std=gnu++98", "-fno-rtti", "-Wvla"],
        "ld": ["-Wl,--gc-sections", "-Wl,--wrap,main", "-Wl,--wrap,_malloc_r",
               "-Wl,--wrap,_free_r", "-Wl,--wrap,_realloc_r",
               "-Wl,--wrap,_calloc_r", "-Wl,--wrap,exit", "-Wl,--wrap,atexit"]
    },
    "ARM": {
        "common": ["-c", "--gnu", "-Otime", "--split_sections",
                   "--apcs=interwork", "--brief_diagnostics", "--restrict",
                   "--multibyte_chars", "-O3"],
        "asm": [],
        "c": ["--md", "--no_depend_system_headers", "--c99", "-D__ASSERT_MSG"],
        "cxx": ["--cpp", "--no_rtti", "--no_vla"],
        "ld": []
    },
    "IAR": {
        "common": [
            "--no_wrap_diagnostics", "non-native end of line sequence", "-e",
            "--diag_suppress=Pa050,Pa084,Pa093,Pa082", "-Oh"],
        "asm": [],
        "c": ["--vla"],
        "cxx": ["--guard_calls", "--no_static_destruction"],
        "ld": ["--skip_dynamic_initialization", "--threaded_lib"]
    }
}
```

In the above example, you can tell that:

- `GCC_ARM`, `ARM` and `IAR` compiler suites are supported.
- The `ARM` C and C++ compilers use optimization level `-O3`.
- The `IAR` linker skips dynamic initialization.

And so on.

## Build rules

The Mbed OS build tools scan your project for source files every time you compile. This document describes the rules that the build tools use to decide which source files to include in each build. The Mbed OS build tools use the [target configuration](adding-and-configuring-targets.html) found in `targets.json`, `mbed_app.json` and `mbed_lib.json` as input to these rules. If you are looking for how to pass options to the compilers, please see the [build profiles documentation](../program-setup/build-profiles-and-rules.html).

The build tools include every source file found in the project unless it is in a label directory, it is in a test directory or it matches a pattern in an `.mbedignore file`.

## Source files

Mbed OS build tools determine the type of source file found based on the file's extension. The following table lists all files used in a build:

| Extension                   | File type         | Used by                        |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| `.a`, `.ar`                 | Archive           | Toolchain's linker             |
| `.c`                        | C source          | Toolchain's C compiler         |
| `.cc`, `.cpp`               | C++ source        | Toolchain's C++ compiler       |
| `.h`, `.hpp`, `.hh`, `.inc` | C/C++ header      | Toolchain's C and C++ compiler |
| `.ld`                       | GCC linker script | GCC's linker (`ld`)            |
| `.o`                        | Object            | Toolchain's linker             |
| `.s`, `.S`                  | Assembly          | Toolchain's assembler          |
| `.sct`                      | ARM scatter file  | ARM's linker (`armlink`)       |


## Label directories

Label directories are directories that follow a naming convention: an upper case label type followed by an underscore followed by a label. The Mbed OS build tools define four label types:

- `TARGET`, constructed from the configuration value `target.extra_labels` and the name of the targets.
- `FEATURE`, constructed from the configuration value `target.features`.
- `FEATURE_EXPERIMENTAL_API`, constructed from the configuration value `target.features`.
- `COMPONENT`, controlled from the configuration value `target.components`.
- `TOOLCHAIN`, controlled completely by the toolchain used to build.

The Mbed OS build tools skip all label directories, unless you configure them explicitly, as described above.

For more information about using, extending and removing labels, please see [Adding and configuring targets](../program-setup/adding-and-configuring-targets.html#extra-labels-extra-labels-add-and-extra-labels-remove).

### Target directories

The target labeled directories are used for selecting sources specific to an MCU or MCU family. The set of directories included in a given build is all of the names of the targets in the inheritance hierarchy and the `target.extra_labels`. The following is an example `targets.json`:

```json
{
    "MCUXPRESSO": {
        "inherits": ["Target"],
        "public": false
    },
    "TEENSY3_1": {
        "inherits": ["MCUXPRESSO"],
        "extra_labels": ["K20XX", "K20DX256"]
    }
}
```

The above example includes source files in directories named `TARGET_MCUXPRESSO` and `TARGET_TEENSY3_1` from the inheritance hierarchy and `TARGET_K20XX` and `TARGET_K20DX256` from the `target.extra_labels` value. It does not include source files within the `TARGET_NORDIC`, `TARGET_K66F` or `TARGET_NUCLEO_F411` directories because they are not in the list of labels included in the label type `TARGET`.

### Feature directories

The feature labeled directories are used for software that implements functionality that requires some amount of space even when it's not used. The configuration value `target.features` entirely controls the set of directories the `FEATURE` label type includes. The following is a trimmed down version of an example `targets.json`:

```json
{
    "NRF52_DK": {
        "inherits": ["Target"],
        "features": ["BLE"]
    }
}
```

In the above example, `mbed compile` includes files in directories named `FEATURE_BLE`, and not directories such as `FEATURE_STORAGE` or `FEATURE_CRYTOCELL310`.

### Experimental directories

By default, Mbed OS doesn't compile [experimental APIs](../introduction/versions-and-releases.html). You can override this behaviour by explicitly including "EXPERIMENTAL_API" in `mbed_app.json`:

```
{
    “target_overrides” : {
        “*” : {
            “target.features_add” : [“EXPERIMENTAL_API”]
     }
  }
}

```

The `EXPERIMENTAL_API` flag enables experimental APIs but may not activate individual APIs. Please follow each API's documentation to use it.  

### Component directories

The component labeled directories are used for software that implements functionality. They are within label directories primarily because we don't expect every program to use this software, and including this software in every build would needlessly increase build time.  The configuration value `target.components` entirely controls the set of directories the `COMPONENT` label type includes. The following is a shortened version of an example `targets.json`:

```json
{
    "NRF52_DK": {
        "inherits": ["Target"],
        "components": ["SPIF"]
    }
}
```

In the above example, `mbed compile` includes files in directories named `COMPONENT_SPIF`, and not directories such as `COMPONENT_SD` or `COMPONENT_FLASHIAP`.

### Toolchain directories

The toolchain labeled directories are used for toolchain specific files, such as assembly or linker files. The compilers use the following label sets:

| Toolchain                    | Labels                                                     |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| ARM compiler 6               | `TOOLCHAIN_ARM`, `TOOLCHAIN_ARM_STD` and `TOOLCHAIN_ARMC6` |
| GCC ARM Embedded             | `TOOLCHAIN_GCC` and `TOOLCHAIN_GCC_ARM`                    |

When compiling with `-t GCC_ARM` or `mbed toolchain GCC_ARM`, source files found within `TOOLCHAIN_GCC` and `TOOLCHAIN_GCC_ARM` are included, and files found within `TOOLCHAIN_IAR` and `TOOLCHAIN_ARM` are not.

## .mbedignore

The `.mbedignore` rules override other rules for excluding files from a build. Files matching patterns in an `.mbedignore` file are excluded from a build even if a label rule or a test directory would include the file.

### Usage

You can place an `.mbedignore` file in any searched directory.

Avoid defining rules that would cross library boundaries because these can lead to side effects or build problems that are hard to find.

### Syntax

Each line in the `.mbedignore` file is a pattern for matching files. No files that matches any pattern found in any `.mbedignore` file are included when building or exporting.

The following wildcards are accepted:

|Pattern | Meaning|
|--------|--------|
| `*` | Matches everything. |
| `?` | Matches any single character. |
| `[seq]` | Matches any character in seq. |
| `[!seq]` | Matches any character not in seq. |

The file is parsed with Python's [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/2/library/fnmatch.html). The syntax follows basic shell patterns with the following exceptions:

- Each line is treated as though it were prefixed with the path of the `.mbedignore` file.
- A line cannot start with `.` or `/` (because of the previous rule).

The globbing functionality is not used, so you cannot recursively match a specific file pattern. Instead, you need to define a rule per directory.

### Example

A file located in `source/obsolete/.mbedignore` has the following content:

```
*.c
*.h
second_level/*.c
```

After applying the first rule, the actual patterns used internally for matching the source files are:

```
source/obsolete/*.c
source/obsolete/*.h
source/obsolete/second_level/*.c
```

## Debug builds

After you've set up your [local debug toolchain](../program-setup/build-profiles-and-rules.html), you need firmware that includes program symbols (an `.elf` file). Because the Arm Mbed Online Compiler only produces binaries that omit the program symbols, you need to compile locally using [Arm Mbed CLI](../build-tools/mbed-cli-1.html).

<span class="notes">**Note:** Make sure to do a clean build when switching to and from debug and release by removing the `BUILD` folder.</span>

## Compile command

```
$ mbed compile --profile mbed-os/tools/profiles/debug.json
```

## Exporting with debug symbols

You can also enable debug symbols when [exporting your project](../build-tools/third-party-build-tools.html) by using:

```
$ mbed export -i uvision -m K64F --profile debug
```

Make release builds by using:

```
$ mbed export -i uvision -m K64F --profile release
```

## Building with the small C libraries

You can build with the smaller C libraries by creating an `mbed_app.json` with the following contents:

 ```
 {
  "requires": ["bare-metal"],
  "target_overrides": {
    "*": {
      "target.c_lib": "small"
    }
  }
}
```

This links your application with `microlib` for the `ARM` toolchain and `newlib-nano` for the `GCC_ARM` toolchain.

<span class="notes">**Note:** If your application uses the Arm microlib, it should not return from `main()`. Please see [non-returning main() below](#non-returning-main) for advice.</span>
