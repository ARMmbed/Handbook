<h1 id="contributing-tools">Tools</h1>

This section describes the tools modifications you need to make when adding a new target to Mbed OS and when making other tools contributions. When adding a new target to Mbed OS, you must [add a new target to Mbed-ls](mbed-ls.html), and you may need to add a postbuild script to the build tools (TODO_CMAKE: add link where post build scripts are for both systems). Further, this section includes instructions for [contributing to the Mbed HDK](arm-mbed-hdk.html)
